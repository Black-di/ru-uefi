No source code here, this is just where I store the RU.EFI and RU.EXE binary files.  
They are all encrypted, please find password on my blog page. http://ruexe.blogspot.com/

RU.EXE was created on 1993 when I started working on BIOS.  Later on I migrated it to RU.EFI for UEFI.
I wrote this tool for my own debugging purpose.  I did not pay too much effort on debugging RU so it could be very buggy.

Hope this tool helps!
